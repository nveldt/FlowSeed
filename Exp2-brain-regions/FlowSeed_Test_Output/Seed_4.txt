Brain Dataset testing region experiments for SEPCI. Epsilon is chosen based on training experiments
Seed sets are made up of a set of initial random starter nodes that make up 3% of the target region, which we grow by their neighborhood.
We include strict constraints on excluding initial starter nodes from the seed set, and a soft penalty of p_r = 1 for excluding any other seed nodes.
